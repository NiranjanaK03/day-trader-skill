# The Day Trader skill

11 Claude skills for day trading: scan thousands of charts, track breaking news, time every entry and exit, and replay every outcome before you risk a dollar.

Free, MIT, no signup, no API key. The tools are plain Python that read free
public data: Yahoo Finance charts, Nasdaq Trader's symbol lists, SEC EDGAR
and the House Clerk.

One scans thousands of charts for setups. Another tracks breaking news on
every stock you watch. One watches a setup bar by bar and tells you the moment
to get in, and another sets your stop and your target before you do. And the
craziest one is the Time Machine: before you risk a dollar, it replays the
rest of the session 10,000 times from the stock's own recent bars, plus every
past day the same setup fired, and tells you the honest odds.

And no trade goes through until you say yes. Nothing in this pack can place
an order on its own. Paper trading is the default.

## This fork: India (NSE), Phase 0

This branch points the pack at the Indian stock market. Every skill reads
`"market"` from `trader/config.json` (or `--market`): `"in"` is the default
here, `"us"` keeps the original NYSE behaviour, and the original tests still
run on it. What `"in"` changes:

| piece | NSE (`"in"`) | NYSE (`"us"`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clock | India time, UTC+5:30 all year | New York, with daylight saving |
| session | 9:15 to 15:30; opening range 9:15 to 9:30 | 9:30 to 16:00 |
| entries, flat by | 9:30 to 14:45, flat by 15:10 | 9:45 to 15:30, flat by 15:55 |
| holidays | NSE 2026 list (past dates checked against Nifty's real trading days) | NYSE 2026 and 2027 |
| universe | `scan.py universe`: NSE's EQUITY_L.csv, series EQ only (trade-to-trade BE/BZ out), within the F&O stock list (`--list fo`, about 213 names) or the Nifty 200 (`--list nifty200`) | Nasdaq Trader lists |
| symbols | RELIANCE, M&M, BAJAJ-AUTO; Yahoo reads them as `SYMBOL.NS` | TSLA, BRK.B |
| time machine | a full session is the 72 bars from 9:15 to 15:15 (F&O stocks then go into the closing auction, which leaves no 5-minute bars) | 78 bars |
| money | rupees (`Rs`) | dollars |
| charges | brokerage (0.03% or Rs 20 an order), STT 0.025% on the sell, NSE 0.00307%, SEBI Rs 10 a crore, stamp 0.003% on the buy, 18% GST: part of the max loss, the daily loss and reward:risk | none |
| broker | `"broker": "manual"`: you place the order yourself; Claude places nothing | Alpaca or IBKR |

`trader-budget/config.example.json` is the India config (Rs 5,00,000, Rs 2,500
max loss a trade, Rs 7,500 a day, reward:risk 1.5 after charges, the charge
rates under `"costs"`); the US one is `config.us.example.json`. The `*_usd`
keys hold rupees on NSE.

The India reel, Monday 2026-10-19, real RELIANCE bars
(`tests/fixtures/trader-india`): range 1,207.30 to 1,223.40; the 9:45 bar
closed at 1,227.80 at 9:50 AM IST; stop 1,215.35 (the midpoint), target
1,252.70 (2R), flat by 15:10. The Time Machine on 55 real sessions: target
first 0.6 %, stop first 17.3 %, "Strongly toward the stop". Sized on Rs
5,00,000: 162 shares (the 40 % position cap binds), Rs 2,016.90 at the stop
plus Rs 117.19 of charges, reward:risk 1.83 after charges: trader-risk passes
it, and the ticket says you place it yourself.

Phase 1, done so far: the NSE risk checks. `scan.py nse-lists` reads NSE's
daily price bands, F&O ban and ASM/GSM lists into `trader/nse.json` each
morning, and trader-risk blocks an entry that is trade-to-trade, in the F&O
ban, under surveillance, in a narrow band, or whose target or stop is past
today's price band (details in `trader-risk/SKILL.md`). And the backtest:
`trader-timemachine/backtest.py collect` grows a store of 5-minute bars (Yahoo
keeps 60 days, so run it every week or two), and `backtest.py run` replays the
opening-range breakout on every stored stock and session with the same
sizing, charges and daily limits, then checks Phase 1's gate (a year of
sessions, 200 trades, positive after charges overall and out of sample,
drawdown within 6 % of the budget). No real money until it says PASS.

Not done yet (Phase 1): an Indian broker connection (Kite Connect or another
broker's API on a whitelisted static IP, under SEBI's 2026 retail algo rules),
real-time data instead of Yahoo, NSE corporate announcements for
`/trader-news` (Yahoo's headline feed matches `.NS` tickers loosely),
fundamentals from NSE/BSE filings for `/trader-analyst` (SEC only today), a
year of stored bars for the backtest, and the 2027 NSE holidays (NSE
publishes them in December). `/trader-pelosi` stays US-only.

## Install

Paste this into Claude:

```
https://github.com/Jakeschincariol/day-trader-skill

install skill
```

Or as a plugin, in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add Jakeschincariol/day-trader-skill
/plugin install day-trader-skill@day-trader-skill
```

Claude Code namespaces plugin skills, so installed as a plugin they show up as
`/day-trader-skill:trader-scanner` and so on. Copy the folders instead if you want
plain `/trader-scanner`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jakeschincariol/day-trader-skill.git
cp -r day-trader-skill/trader-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Project-local instead of global: copy the same folders into your repo's
`.claude/skills/`. No Claude Code at all? Paste any single `SKILL.md` at the
top of a chat and it runs as a mode. You lose the Python tools, but the method
works.

The tools need Python 3.8 or newer. Nothing to pip install. The SEC tools
(news filings, the analyst) ask you to identify yourself: put your name and
email in `trader/config.json` (`"sec_user_agent": "Your Name you@example.com"`)
or in the `SEC_USER_AGENT` environment variable.

## The eleven

| `/trader-risk` | Risk Manager | Checks every trade against your limits and stops anything over them. |
| `/trader-budget` | Budget Manager | Sizes every position to your budget and your max loss per trade. |
| `/trader-broker` | Order Executor | Sends approved orders to your broker, paper trading by default, never without your yes. |
| `/trader-alerts` | Price Alerts | Rings when a price, a stop or the opening bell hits. |

| `/trader-pelosi` | Pelosi Tracker | Reads Congress's stock-trade disclosures the minute they are filed. |

## How to use it

Everything lands in a `trader/` folder in your project, and each skill reads
what the last one wrote:

```
scanner -> news -> entry -> exit -> timemachine -> budget -> risk -> broker   (one trade)
alerts: stop, target, flat by the close                                       (while it is open)
news / analyst / pelosi                                                        (on a schedule)
```

An example, the trade in the reel: Tesla, Monday October 19 2026, real data.

1. **`/trader-scanner`** at 10:15 AM ET: of the 231 charts in the reel's
   scan, 42 had closed above their 15-minute opening range. TSLA is one: range 354.47 to 362.18,
   the 10:10 candle closed at 364.18, 0.55 % over the top.
2. **`/trader-news`**: the morning's TSLA headlines, in New York time
   ("Tesla-SpaceX Merger Mania Strikes Wall Street Ahead of Earnings", 8:04,
   tagged earnings and deal). Tesla reports this week: a day trade is out
   before the close, so it is not exposed to the report.
3. **`/trader-entry`** watched TSLA bar by bar. At 10:12 it said waiting (the
   10:10 bar was still forming). At 10:15 it said triggered: the first
   5-minute close above the range, 364.18.
4. **`/trader-exit`** set the plan before the entry: stop at the range's
   midpoint, 358.32, so 5.86 a share at risk; target one times that risk,
   370.04; flat by 3:55 PM either way.
5. **`/trader-timemachine`** replayed the rest of the day 10,000 times, each
   5-minute candle drawn from TSLA's own candles at that time of day over the
   previous 59 sessions (seed 19, so anyone can repeat it): target first
   29.4 %, stop first 25.5 %, still open at the close 45.1 %. It also re-ran
   the same rule on those 59 real sessions: it fired 33 times, 13 hit the
   target, 15 the stop, 5 neither. Its verdict: close to a coin flip. That is
   the point of looking before you risk a dollar.
6. **`/trader-budget`** with a $5,000 account and a $50 max loss per trade:
   50 / 5.86 = 8 shares ($2,913.44). If the stop fills at 358.32, the loss is
   $46.88. It writes one bracket order: buy 8 TSLA, stop-loss 358.32,
   take-profit 370.04.
7. **`/trader-risk`** checks it against your limits: the max loss, the daily
   loss limit, trades per day, reward to risk, the entry window, position
   size and cash. PASS or BLOCK, with the reason.
8. **`/trader-broker`** shows you the ticket in plain words. You type yes for
   that exact order. Claude calls your brokerage connector (Alpaca's MCP
   server, paper account by default), and Claude's own "Allow once / Deny"
   card asks you one more time.
9. **`/trader-alerts`** rings on the stop, the target and at 3:55 PM to
   flatten whatever is still open.

## The tools

All standard-library Python. The data tools read public endpoints and are
polite about it.

```bash
python3 trader-scanner/scan.py universe                                # ~5,900 US stocks, Nasdaq Trader
python3 trader-scanner/scan.py daily                                   # pre-market setups, whole universe
python3 trader-scanner/scan.py orb --at 10:15                          # opening-range breakouts so far
python3 trader-news/news.py --tickers TSLA --hours 12                  # headlines, 8-Ks, today's move
python3 trader-entry/entry.py check TSLA --setup orb                   # waiting / triggered / expired
python3 trader-entry/entry.py watch TSLA --every 30                    # bar by bar until it triggers
python3 trader-exit/exit.py plan --stop or-mid --target 1R --write     # -> trader/plan.json
python3 trader-timemachine/timemachine.py run --write                  # 10,000 replays + the history
python3 trader-budget/size.py --write                                  # -> trader/orders.json
python3 trader-risk/check.py                                           # PASS / BLOCK per order
python3 trader-broker/ticket.py show                                   # the tickets, READY or not
python3 trader-alerts/alerts.py add --from-plan                        # stop, target, flat by close
python3 trader-alerts/alerts.py check                                  # rings what hit, once
python3 trader-analyst/facts.py TSLA                                   # quarters, growth, EPS
python3 trader-pelosi/ptr.py index --member pelosi                     # her PTRs this year
```

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The tests run offline, on fixtures cut from real data: TSLA's 5-minute bars
for the 60 days to October 19 2026, the 10:15 AM opening-range scan, Yahoo's
TSLA headlines that morning, the House Clerk's 2026 index, real PTR text and
real XBRL facts. They reproduce every number in the example above.

## Fine print

**Not financial advice.** This is software that reads public data and does
arithmetic. It does not know your situation and it cannot see the future.
Most people who day trade lose money. You can lose money. Decide for
yourself, and talk to a licensed professional if you need advice.

**No trade goes through until you say yes.** Only `/trader-broker` can lead to
an order, and only after `/trader-risk` passes that exact order and you type
yes for it in the chat. Set your brokerage tool to "Needs approval" in Claude
(Customize, Connectors, tool permissions), never "Always allow", so Claude's
own "Allow once / Deny" card is a second check. No options, margin, short
selling or leverage unless you turn them on.

**Paper first.** `"paper": true` is the default in `config.example.json`, and
Alpaca's MCP server defaults to its paper account. Keys live in environment
variables, never in the chat.

**The Time Machine is a simulation, not a prediction.** It is built from the
stock's own last 60 days of 5-minute bars. The future can do things those 60
days never did: an earnings report, a halt, a headline. Treat its odds as a
reality check, never as a promise.

**A stop is a plan, not a guarantee.** In a fast market or across a gap, a
stop order can fill well past its price. The max loss shown is the loss at
the stop price.

**The data is free and unofficial.** Yahoo Finance's chart endpoint is not an
official API: it can lag, change or rate-limit you. The scanner and the entry
timer read 1-minute or 5-minute bars, not every tick. Check anything that
matters against your broker before you act on it.

**Day-trading rules.** FINRA removed the $25,000 pattern-day-trader minimum
on June 4, 2026 (Regulatory Notice 26-10), and brokers may phase the change
in until October 20, 2027, so yours may still apply the old rule. If it does,
set `"pdt_guard": true` and `/trader-risk` counts your day trades.

**Congress's trades are public, not inside information.** Members must disclose
trades over $1,000 within 45 days (the STOCK Act). The Pelosi skill reads those
public filings the minute they post.

**Taxes.** Day-trading gains are short-term gains, and frequent trading makes
wash sales likely. Nothing here is tax advice.
